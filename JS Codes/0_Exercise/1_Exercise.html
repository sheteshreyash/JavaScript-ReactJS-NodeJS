<!-- Write a JavaScript program to generate a random number and store it in a variable.
    The program then takes an input from
    the user to tell them whether the guess was correct, greater or lesser than the original number.

    100 – (no of guesses) is the score of the user.
    The program is expected to terminate once the number is guesses.
    Number should be between 1 – 100. -->
