// Variables in javascript

let a = 67  // We will use 'let' function to declare a which contains 67
console.log(a)
a = "Shreyash"  // type of a will change from integer to string
console.log(a)

// javascript allows to change the variables types at runtime
// and that's why it is called dynamic type programming language

// let 8shrey = 9  // This will throw error

// JavaScript is a Case Sensitive Programming Language
